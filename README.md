# FedE

This repository is the implementation of IJCKG 2021 paper: [FedE: Embedding Knowledge Graphs in Federated Setting](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3502223.3502233). In this work, we propose a Federated Knowledge Graph Embedding framework, FedE, focusing on learning knowledge graph embeddings by aggregating locally-computed updates.

## Requirements
+ python
+ PyTorch
+ NumPy
+ tqdm

## Date 
We put our experimential datasets in ``./data``, and give data details in its README.

## Training and Testing

We give the example scripts for reproducing our experimental results in ```./script```, you can try following commands. To properly run these scripts, you may specify the GPU index in scripts.

### 1. FedE, TransE, on dataset FB15k-237-Fed3
```bash
sh ./script/run_fb237_fed3_transe_fede.sh
```

### 2. Isolation, TransE, on dataset FB15k-237-Fed3
```bash
sh ./script/run_fb237_fed3_transe_isolation.sh
```

After finishing above two experiments on the setting of FedE and Isolation, you can run model fusion based on the example script:

```bash
sh ./script/run_fb237_fed3_transe_fede_model_fusion.sh
```

### 3. Collection, TransE, on dataset FB15k-237-Fed3
```bash
sh ./script/run_fb237_fed3_transe_collection.sh
```
